# Principles

## Structure
- **Single responsibility**: Each section owns exactly one concern; split when scope creeps.
- **Order within sections**: Goal first, steps second, verification last.
- **References over inline**: Reusable patterns belong in `/refs`, not repeated in SKILL.md.
- **Over-Engineering:** Complex structure for simple skills, start small and specialist
- **Oversized:**  >500 lines -> Extract, splice and suggest splitting to the user

## Instructions
- **Imperatives only**: Write "Do X" not "You should do X" or "It is important to X."
- **Atomic steps**: One action per step. If "and" appears, split the step.
- **Explicit outputs**: Every step ends with a verifiable artifact or state change.
- **Negatives must have positives**: Write "Don't do X (do Y)" instead of singular negative instructions

## Compression
- **Max signal per token**: If a word can be removed without losing meaning, remove it.
- **Context-free sentences**: Each rule must be understood without reading surrounding rules.
- **No hedging**: Omit "typically", "usually", "in most cases" — state the rule or omit it.
- **Scarcity**: Context is scarce: Put critical instructions first or last, never buried. Cut tokens that don't earn their place.

## Quality
- **Testable criteria**: Define done as an observable outcome, not a process followed.
- **Defaults before exceptions**: State the rule, then the exception on a new line. Example: "Use imperatives. Exception: rationale paragraphs may use declarative voice."
- **Stable vocabulary**: Use the same term for the same concept throughout; never synonym-swap.

## Calibration
- **Match output to tier**: Output shape must match the confirmed complexity tier. Do not add sections, ref files, or folder nesting beyond the tier's declared shape.
- **Defaults before overrides**: Apply the base tier shape first; override individual dimensions only when a specific signal justifies it.

# Anti-Patterns (Token Wasters)
- **Verbose Explanations:** "This is important because..." → Delete
- **Redundant Info:** Same info in multiple places
