# Plan Template

Every plan output must follow this structure. Sections appear in this
order. Required sections cannot be empty. Optional sections may be omitted.

For workflow diagram conventions, see `workflow-template.md`.
For persona structure, see `persona.md`.

## 0. Complexity Tier (required)

Declare the confirmed tier at the top of every plan. `agent-build` uses this to validate output shape.

```yaml
tier: Simple | Standard | Complex
```

Tier constraints — each tier declares which sections are required (✓), optional (○), or forbidden (✗):

| Section | Simple | Standard | Complex |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|
| Persona | ✗ | ○ | ✓ |
| Workflow diagram | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Reference files | 0–1 | 1–4 | 3+ |
| Sub-skills | ✗ | ○ | ○ |
| Folder nesting | Flat | 1 level | 2 levels |

### Per-dimension overrides

Override individual dimensions when a strong signal contradicts the base tier default. Fill the override column only when a specific signal applies — leave blank otherwise.

| Dimension | Simple | Standard | Complex | Override condition |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Persona | Omit | Optional | Required | User names an explicit specialist role at any tier |
| Workflow diagram | Omit | Required | Required | Multi-step flow detected at Simple tier |
| Ref count | 0–1 | 1–4 | 3+ | A reusable vocabulary or template is clearly needed beyond the cap |
| Sub-skills | None | Optional | Allowed | Composition signal detected at any tier |
| Folder nesting | Flat | 1 level | 2 levels | Sub-skills require isolation; never exceed 2 levels |

## 1. Skill identity (required)

YAML frontmatter for the generated SKILL.md.

- `name`: kebab-case identifier
- `description`: one line, ~80 words or fewer, covers what the skill does
  and when to consult it
- `type`: skill type if applicable
- `output_dir` (optional): absolute path chosen by the user in agent-plan Step 7.
  Omit this field for Global installs. When present, agent-build writes all skill
  files under this directory instead of `.claude/skills/<name>/`.

## 2. Trigger conditions (required)

When Claude should consult this skill. List concrete conditions, not
generalities.

- User phrases that should activate it
- Task shapes or contexts that match
- File types or artifacts that signal relevance

## 3. Persona (conditional)

Include this section only when the agent embodies a specialist human role
(e.g. the user named "product manager", "senior engineer", "UX researcher",
or Q1 + Q7 point to role-specific judgment). Omit it entirely for
task-oriented agents (classification, summarisation, extraction, routing,
validation) where no human role is implied.

When included, all seven axes from `persona.md` must be filled with
role-specific content:

1. Role identity
2. Values
3. Knowledge & expertise
4. Anti-patterns
5. Decision-making
6. Pushback style
7. Communication texture

## 4. Inputs and outputs (required)

- **Inputs**: what the skill receives (files, prompts, prior context).
  Name format and source for each.
- **Outputs**: what the skill produces (artifacts, structured data, side
  effects). Name format and destination for each.

## 5. Workflow (required)

The skill's protocol, in two parts:

- **Diagram**: ASCII workflow per `workflow-template.md`.
- **Protocol**: numbered prose steps. Each step states its purpose, the
  action taken, and the resulting output.

Diagram and prose must describe the same flow. If they diverge, sharpen
both until they match.

## 6. Reference files (optional)

Refs the skill will need. One bullet per ref:

- `<filename.md>` — one-line purpose

## 7. Scripts (optional)

Helper scripts to bundle. One bullet per script:

- `<filename.py>` — one-line purpose
