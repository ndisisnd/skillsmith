# Interview

## Modes

**Flash** — ask Q1, Q4, Q5 only. Fill the rest with smart defaults. Use when the user says "quick", "draft", "fast", or sets `mode: flash`.
**Thinking** — ask up to 8 questions. Default mode.

## Opening

Skip if the user has already stated a clear ask.

Otherwise ask exactly one open question, with a generated example matching the user's likely domain:

> "What do you want to build? Example: '{a one-line agent description matching the user's likely domain}'."

Generate the example fresh each time. Never reuse a fixed string.

## Questions (MCQ, max 8)

Every question is multiple-choice with an "Other" option. Ask one at a time. Skip a question when its answer is already implied by an earlier one.

| # | Question | Options | Maps to |
|---|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | What domain does this agent work in? | engineering / design / data / writing / Other | persona archetype |
| 2 | When should it activate? | slash command / keyword in prompt / file type match / Other | triggers |
| 3 | What does it consume? | a file or diff / a prompt or spec / prior conversation / Other | inputs |
| 4 | What does it produce? | code / a document / a decision or recommendation / Other | outputs |
| 5 | Workflow shape and gates? | single-shot, no gate / single-shot, gated before output / multi-step, gated mid-flow / Other | workflow + gates |
| 6 | What must it refuse? | destructive ops / out-of-domain asks / ambiguous scope / Other | refusal scope |
| 7 | What expertise must it have that a generalist lacks? | named framework / domain rules / proprietary process / Other | specialisation |
| 8 | What dependencies does it need? (multi-select) | none / MCP server(s) / external API(s) / shell tools / Other | tools + refs |

Q7 and Q8 accept open text inside "Other" — Q7's answer seeds the persona's knowledge axis; Q8's answer seeds the tools and refs sections.

## Signal flagging

After every answer, scan for these signals. Flag once per signal, never twice.

| Signal | Trigger | Response |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Vague | Answer contains "various", "etc", "general", "stuff" | Quote the word; ask for one concrete instance |
| Unbounded | Answer claims "any", "all", "every" without limit | Ask for the boundary case |
| Conflicting | Two answers contradict (e.g. Q1=generalist, Q7=specialist refusal) | Quote both; ask which holds |
| Overlapping | Spec matches an existing skill in the registry | Name the skill; ask for the differentiator |

## Spec capture

Fill this table from the answers. No prose, no extra fields.

| Field | Source | Required |
|-------|--------|----------|
| name | derived from ask | yes |
| description | one line, ≤80 chars | yes |
| persona | Q1 + Q7 | conditional — see detection rule below |
| triggers | Q2 | yes |
| inputs | Q3 | yes |
| outputs | Q4 | yes |
| workflow | Q5 | yes |
| gates | Q5 | yes |
| refusals | Q6 | yes |
| dependencies | Q8 | yes |
| refs | Q8 + derived | optional |
| scripts | Q8 + derived | optional |

### Persona detection rule

Include a persona only when the agent embodies a specialist human role. Leave the field blank otherwise — do not invent a role to fill it.

**Include persona when:**
- The user names a specific role (e.g. "product manager", "senior engineer", "UX researcher")
- Q1 + Q7 together point to a domain expert whose role-specific judgment shapes every output

**Omit persona when:**
- The agent is task-oriented: classification, summarisation, extraction, routing, validation, translation
- No specific human role is implied by the ask or the interview answers
- The required expertise is tool/framework knowledge rather than role-specific judgment

## Tier inference

After the spec table is filled and all signal flags are resolved, infer the output tier from three signals:

| Signal | How to detect | Weight |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Step count | Q5 "single-shot" → Low; "multi-step" → High | Major |
| I/O breadth | Multiple input types (Q3) or branching/multiple outputs (Q4) → High | Major |
| Sub-skill / composition | Q5 or Q8 indicates invoking other skills or spawning agents → High | Major |

Map High-signal count to a base tier:

| High signals | Tier |
|-------------|------|
| 0 | Simple |
| 1 | Standard |
| 2–3 | Complex |

Emit: `[TIER: <tier>] — <one-line rationale citing which signals drove the decision>`

If the user stated a tier explicitly in their initial ask, skip inference and use their stated tier.

Hand off to the plan generator when every required row is filled, no signal flags are open, and the tier is confirmed.

## Conduct rules

- Ask one question at a time. Wait for the answer.
- Prefix every question with a progress counter `QN/T` where `N` is the position of the question in the current run and `T` is the total questions planned for the active mode. Totals: `thinking` = 8, `flash` = 3. Examples: `Q1/8`, `Q3/8`, `Q1/3`, `Q3/3`. Increment `N` only for questions actually asked — skipped questions (because the answer is already implied or the opening ask was provided) do not advance the counter, and they do not change `T`. Render the counter as bold at the start of the question line, e.g. `**Q3/8** — When should it activate?`.
- Present options as a numbered list. Accept the number or the label.
- Quote the user's chosen option back when confirming. Do not paraphrase.
- Never invent an answer. An empty field is a signal to ask, not to guess.
